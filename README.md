Mancala is a game that has versions which date back to 7th century Ancient Egypt. 
It typically consists of a board with 12 holes or "cups", 6 on either side and a main "store" and each end.

# Technologies used

# Getting Started

https://reginasherman.github.io/mancala-project/

Play begins with 4 stones in each of the 12 cups.
The main object of the game is to capture all or some of the other player's stones in your store.
In this game, the stones are represented by numbers.


# Next Steps 

I would like to add a few more special cases to the gameplay, more graphics and animation, and an updated UI.
